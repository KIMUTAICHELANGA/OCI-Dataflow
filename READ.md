# PySpark OCI Data Flow Example

## Overview

This repository provides an example project demonstrating how to leverage Apache Spark with PySpark on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Flow for scalable data processing and analytics. 

## Features

- **PySpark Integration**: Utilize the powerful capabilities of Apache Spark through PySpark, Python's Spark API, for distributed data processing and analytics.
  
- **OCI Data Flow**: Leverage OCI Data Flow, a fully managed Apache Spark service on OCI, for serverless and scalable execution of PySpark applications.

- **Sample Application**: Includes a sample PySpark application showcasing common data processing tasks, such as data ingestion, transformation, and analysis, using OCI Data Flow.

- **Integration with OCI Services**: Demonstrates how to integrate with other OCI services, such as Object Storage, for seamless data access and processing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the example application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account
- Python installed on your local machine
- OCI CLI installed and configured
- Basic understanding of Apache Spark and PySpark

## Getting Started

To get started with the example application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyspark-oci-dataflow.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd pyspark-oci-dataflow
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to set up your OCI environment, configure the OCI Data Flow job, and execute the PySpark application.
